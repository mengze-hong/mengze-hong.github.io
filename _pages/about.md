Hi, I am Mengze Hong, a PhD student in the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by [Prof. Qing Li](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-li-qing/?sc_lang=en) and [Prof. Chen Jason Zhang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-zhang-chen-jason/?sc_lang=en). I received my bachelor's degree with first-class honours from the University of Nottingham at age 20, igniting my passion for research. Before joining PolyU, I have worked as a Research Intern at the WeBank AI Group, collaborating closely with [Prof. Di Jiang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-jiang-di/?sc_lang=en) on advancing LLM applications in banking and customer service. For more details, please refer to my [CV](https://mengze-hong.github.io/files/CV.pdf).


My research interests include:
- **LLM application and benchmarking**, especially in the banking industry.
- **Speech Processing**, especially ASR in service systems.

If you are interested in any form of academic collaboration, please feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:mengze.hon@connect.polyu.hk).
