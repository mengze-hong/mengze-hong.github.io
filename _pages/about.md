<!-- ## About Me -->

I am **Mengze Hong** (洪梦泽), a Ph.D candidate at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by [Prof. Qing Li](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-li-qing/?sc_lang=en) and [Prof. Chen Jason Zhang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-zhang-chen-jason/?sc_lang=en). I completed my bachelor's degree with first-class honors from the University of Nottingham in 2024. Before joining PolyU, I worked as a Research Intern at the WeBank AI Group, collaborating closely with [Prof. Di Jiang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-jiang-di/?sc_lang=en) on advancing LLM applications in banking and customer service. For more details, please refer to my [CV](https://mengze-hong.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

My research focuses on LLM applications and benchmarking, especially combining their human-level natural language understanding with reliable deterministic generation mechanisms (e.g., retrieval-based systems). If you are interested in any form of academic collaboration, please feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:mengze.hong@connect.polyu.hk).
