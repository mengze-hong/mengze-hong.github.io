<!-- ## About Me -->

I am **Mengze Hong**, a Ph.D candidate at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by Prof. [Qing Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D1LEg-YAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Chen Jason Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=U6-ouN0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I completed my bachelor's degree with First-class Honors from the University of Nottingham in 2024. Before joining PolyU, I worked as a Research Intern at the [WeBank AI Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-computing/), collaborating closely with Dr. [Di Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NyLaViwAAAAJ&hl) on advancing LLM applications in banking and customer service. For more details, please refer to my [CV](https://mengze-hong.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

# Research
I am broadly interested in natural language processing and data mining, prioritizing real-world deployment performance over theoretical advancements. My current research focuses on **LLM-in-the-loop methodologies** for dialogue data mining and customer service applications. I also engage in interdisciplinary studies at the intersection of "LLM x Education" and "LLM x Finance".
