<!-- ## About Me -->

I am **Mengze Hong** (æ´ªæ¢¦æ³½), a Ph.D candidate at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by Prof. [Qing Li](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-li-qing/?sc_lang=en) and Prof. [Chen Jason Zhang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-zhang-chen-jason/?sc_lang=en). I completed my bachelor's degree with first-class honors from the University of Nottingham in 2024. Before joining PolyU, I worked as a Research Intern at the [WeBank AI Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-computing/), collaborating closely with Dr. [Di Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NyLaViwAAAAJ&hl) on advancing LLM applications in banking and customer service. For more details, please refer to my [CV](https://mengze-hong.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

ðŸ“¬ I am open to collaborating with students and industry practitioners on projects related to (but not limited to) the topics below. If interested, please feel free to reach out via email.

# Research
My research focuses on making LLMs more accessible for practical use in a cost-efficient and privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, my work can be summarized in the following directions:

- **LLM-in-the-loop Data Mining**: Exploring the use of lightweight LLM utilities to assist traditional data mining algorithms for cost-effective performance improvement. This includes our pioneering work on [LLM-in-the-loop paradigm](https://www.techrxiv.org/users/912378/articles/1285957-llm-in-the-loop-replicating-human-insight-with-llms-for-better-machine-learning-applications), along with a series of empirical applications such as [intent clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09049) and [topic modelling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08498),  emphasizing algorithm interpretability and result usability.

- **Dialogue Model Optimization**: Investigating novel design principles to optimize dialogue models in the LLM era for improved applications in customer service and call centers. This includes [persona augmentation](https://aclanthology.org/2025.naacl-industry.71/), [knowledge expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12444v3), [query correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04393), and enhanced contextual guidance.

- **Interdisciplinary Applications of LLM**: Exploring the applications of LLMs in multidisciplinary studies, with recent focus on [LLM in education](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-98462-4_19).
