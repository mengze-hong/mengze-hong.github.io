<!-- ## About Me -->

I am **Mengze Hong** (洪梦泽), a Ph.D candidate at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by [Prof. Qing Li](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-li-qing/?sc_lang=en) and [Prof. Chen Jason Zhang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-zhang-chen-jason/?sc_lang=en). I completed my bachelor's degree with first-class honors from the University of Nottingham in 2024. Before joining PolyU, I worked as a Research Intern at the WeBank AI Group, collaborating closely with [Dr. Di Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NyLaViwAAAAJ&hl) on advancing LLM applications in banking and customer service. For more details, please refer to my [CV](https://mengze-hong.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

📬 I'm excited to collaborate with students and industry professionals on projects related to (but not limited to) the topics below. If you’re interested, please feel free to reach out via email.

# Research
My research focuses on making LLMs more accessible for practical use in a cost-efficient and privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, my work can be summarized in the following directions:

- **LLM-in-the-loop Data Mining**: Investigating the integration of lightweight LLM utilities to augment traditional data mining algorithms for cost-effective performance enhancement. This includes our pioneering work on defining the [LLM-in-the-loop paradigm](https://www.techrxiv.org/users/912378/articles/1285957-llm-in-the-loop-replicating-human-insight-with-llms-for-better-machine-learning-applications), along with a series of empirical studies including [dialogue intent clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09049) and [topic modelling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08498), improving algorithm interpretability and ensuring practical result usability.

- **Dialogue Model Optimization**: Investigating novel design principles to optimize dialogue models in the LLM era for improved applications in customer service and call centers. This includes [persona augmentation](https://aclanthology.org/2025.naacl-industry.71/), [knowledge expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12444v3), [query correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04393), and enhanced contextual guidance.

- **Interdisciplinary Applications of LLMs**: Investigating the use of LLMs across multidisciplinary domains, with recent work focusing on LLMs for Education and LLMs for Scholars. This line of research aims to develop tools that promote the ethical use of LLMs and enhance research workflow efficiency through an LLM-in-the-loop design philosophy.
